Node.js test runner
    - features
    - really fast
    - uses internal node.js algorithms and leverage the C++ power

Why recreating stuff ?
    ESLINT
    Uglify
    WebSocket
    Node.js
Now
    Node.js test runner

I'm part of the nodejs
    - implemented the first draft of mock timers

But whats a test runner ?
    1. CLI that receives a folder and executes files
    2. Module that can order and report errors

Pieces
    - test-runner - executor
    - formatter
    - reporter

Executor challenges
    - Must run data in parallel
    - Must know the call three
        - describe and it can be declared in any place and you should know the tree back
        - how?
    - Introducing Async Hooks
    - Introducing Async LocalStorage
        - show Web API Example
            - users are concurrent, we won't like to use global variables and store user's data across sessions
    - Creating the first demo
    - Running demo  - show demo on test-runner (creating test )

Reporters
    - Show how many reporters nodejs support
    - demo reporters
